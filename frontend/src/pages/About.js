                        We believe families with a critically-ill child should not have to lose their job, health, 
                        home or enter into bankruptcy to care for their child during a medical crisis. 
                        To help mitigate this, we mobilize people and resources to meet daily living 
                        requirements of families who do not qualify for government assistance.

                        where guidance and assistance is offered freely as people and organizations collaborate to compassionately 
                        respond to those navigating life-threatening health crises. We seek to demystify the plethora of service 
                        organizations and to make them easily accessible, thereby easing the journey of those in medical crisis.
